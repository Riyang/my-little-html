	  I used &lt;em&gt; in her:     <em>ViVi</em>
	  <br>and then, <br>
	  I used &lt;strong&gt; in her: <strong>ViVi</strong>
	</p>
	
	<h2>&lt;pre&gt;</h2>

	  <pre>
        ViVi, 
        are you there?
        are you happy now?
	  </pre>
	</p>
	<pre>
        I(R.Yang) hope that you'll be happy for the rest of your life.
        I wish some guy will take care of you, give you the happiness you want.
        That's all I want.
        "some guy" would not be me. I think I can be the one you want, but I couldn't.
        I am not your Mr.Right, you've told me that before, in a lonely night.
        That's fine, although it cost me more than six months to get out of the sadness.
        You are good, good enough for me. Or, I wanna say:
        You are perfect, perfect for me.
        But I am not good enough for you.
        Good luck, ViVi. :)
